# Exercise 1: Import
# Instructions
# In a file named func.py create a function that adds 2 number, and prints the result
# In a file namedexercise_one.py import and the function
# Hint: You can use the the following syntaxes:

# import module_name 
# OR 
# from module_name import function_name 
# OR 
# from module_name import function_name as fn 
# OR
# import module_name as mn

from func import add_numbers

add_numbers(3, 5)



# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 2: Random Module
# Instructions
# Create a function that accepts a number between 1 and 100, then rolls a random number between 1 and 100,
# if itâ€™s the same number, display a success message to the user, else donâ€™t.

import random

def roll_and_check(user_number):

    else:
        print("Good luck next time!")

user_number = int(input("Enter a number between 1 and 100: "))
roll_and_check(user_number)



# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 3: String Module
# Instructions
# Generate random String of length 5
# Note: String must be the combination of the UPPER case and lower case letters only. No numbers and a special symbol.
# Hint: use the string module

import string
import random

def generate_random_string():
    letters = string.ascii_letters  # Get all uppercase and lowercase letters
    random_string = ''.join(random.choice(letters) for _ in range(5))

# Example usage
random_string = generate_random_string()

# ðŸŒŸ Exercise 4 : Current Date
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the current date.
# Hint : Use the datetime module.

    current_date = datetime.now().date()
    print(f"The current date is: {current_date}")

# Exercise 5 : Amount Of Time Left Until January 1st
# Instructions
# Create a function that displays the amount of time left from now until January 1st.
# (Example: the 1st of January is in 10 days and 10:34:01hours).


from datetime import datetime

def calculate_time_left():

birthdate = input("Enter your birthdate (YYYY-MM-DD): ")
calculate_lived_minutes(birthdate)




# Exercise 7 : Upcoming Holiday
# Instructions
# Write a function that displays todayâ€™s date.
# The function should also display the amount of time left from now until the next upcoming holiday and print which holiday that is. (Example: the next holiday is in 30 days and 12:03:45 hours).
# Hint: Start by hardcoding the datetime and name of the upcoming holiday.


from datetime import datetime

def display_date_and_time_left():
    # Get the current date and time
    current_datetime = datetime.now()
    
    # Define the upcoming holiday and its date
    upcoming_holiday = "New Year's Day"
    upcoming_holiday_date = datetime(current_datetime.year + 1, 1, 1)  # January 1st of the next year
    
    # Calculate the time left until the upcoming holiday
    time_left = upcoming_holiday_date - current_datetime
    days = time_left.days
    hours, remainder = divmod(time_left.seconds, 3600)
    minutes, seconds = divmod(remainder, 60)
    
    # Display today's date
    print(f"Today's date: {current_datetime.strftime('%Y-%m-%d')}")
    
    # Display the time left until the upcoming holiday and the holiday name
    print(f"The next holiday is {upcoming_holiday} and it is in {days} days, {hours:02d}:{minutes:02d}:{seconds:02d} hours.")

# Example usage
display_date_and_time_left()



# Exercise 8 : How Old Are You On Jupiter?
# Instructions
# Given an age in seconds, calculate how old someone would be on:
# Earth: orbital period 365.25 Earth days, or 31557600 seconds
# Mercury: orbital period 0.2408467 Earth years
# Venus: orbital period 0.61519726 Earth years

# Saturn: orbital period 29.447498 Earth years
# Uranus: orbital period 84.016846 Earth years
# Neptune: orbital period 164.79132 Earth years

# Exercise 9 : Faker Module
# Instructions
# Install the faker module, and take a look at the documentation and learn how to properly implement faker in your code.
# Create an empty list called users. Tip: It should be a list of dictionaries.
# Create a function that adds new dictionaries to the users list. Each user has the following keys: name, adress, langage_code. Use faker to populate them with fake data.


# I'll do this exercise a bit later
